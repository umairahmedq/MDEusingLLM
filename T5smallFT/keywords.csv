We created gridded data for near-surface relative humidity (hurs), cloud area fraction (clt), near-surface wind speed (sfcWind), vapour pressure deficit (vpd), surface downwelling shortwave radiation (rsds), potential evapotranspiration (pet), climate moisture index (cmi), and site water balance (swb), at a monthly temporal and 30 arcsec spatial resolution globally starting 1980 until 2018.

The basic designation for wildlife is the Natural Heritage Area (NHA). This is an area considered important for the habitats present or which holds species of plants and animals whose habitat needs protection. 

To date, 75 raised Bogs have been given legal protection, covering some 23,000 hectares. These raised Bogs are located mainly in the Midlands. A further 73 blanket Bogs, covering 37.000 ha, mostly in western areas are also designated as NHAs.

In addition, there are 630 proposed NHAs (pNHAs), which were published on a non-statutory basis in 1995, but have not since been statutorily proposed or designated. These sites are of significance for wildlife and habitats. Some of the pNHAs are tiny, such as a roosting place for rare bats. Others are large – a Woodland or a lake, for example. The pNHAs cover approximately 65.000 ha and designation will proceed on a phased basis over the coming years.

Please note that these synopses are based in many cases on old survey data and may not accurately reflect the status of the site at the current time.


The Geological Survey of Ireland (GSI) is performing a list of Geological/geomorphological sites in need of protection through NHA designation. A committee of expert geologists provides an initial list of sites which then a process of survey, reporting and review, to provide recommendations regarding NHA status or otherwise. The GSI has completed its list of Karst (i.e. Exposed limestone) and early Fossil sites.

Priority to statutory designation, pNHAs are subject to limited protection, in the form of:
Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) plans which require conservation of pNHAs and operate for a period of 5 years
Forest Service requirement for NPWS approval before they will pay afforestation grants on pNHA lands
Recognition of the ecological value of pNHAs by Planning and Licencing Authorities. 
Under the Wildlife Amendment Act (2000), NHAs are legally protected from damage from the date they are formally proposed for designation.","http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/data-theme/EDUC, https://data.gov.ie/Arts","coastal heritage, environment, environmental monitoring facilities, heritage council, natural heritage areas","coastal heritage, environment, environmental monitoring facilities, heritage council, natural heritage areas","Dataset owned and provided by NPWS.

Wrecks in the database date to all periods; the earliest vessels represented being prehistoric logboats which are primarily found within Ireland’s inland waterways. With the Intensification of shipping activity from the late medieval period onwards, the number of wrecking events off Irish waters increased exponentially with significant numbers occurring during the 18th and 19th centuries. This trend continued and the tumultuous events of the two World Wars in the first half of the 20th Century resulted in much larger numbers of vessels being lost in the waters surrounding Ireland, with an estimated 1,800 shipping casualties relating to both conflicts.

Information contained in the WIID is derived from a wide variety of sources including: UKHO wreck data; the National Museum of Ireland; 18th and 19th-century surveys and sea Charts; Lloyd’s List and Lloyd’s Register of Shipping; Historic newspapers; Parliamentary Papers; local and international Journals; fishermen’s marks; charts and Cartographic sources. Important information on wrecks has been Obtained during targeted fieldwork carried out by the National Monuments Service’s Underwater Archaeology Unit (UAU), drawing on first-hand accounts from Divers, fishermen, coastal Walkers, independent archaeologists, other marine and inland-waterways users, often supplemented by the records held in the Dept. of Irish Folklore, University College Dublin.  

The extensive seabed mapping programme carried out by the Geological Survey of Ireland and the Marine Institute as part of the INFOMAR project is very important, leading to the discovery of significant numbers of new wreck sites.
It has also produced new high-resolution survey data on hundreds of other known wreck sites in Irish waters.
NMS endeavours to ensure that the information in the Wreck Viewer is as accurate as possible.
As only a relatively small percentage of wrecks have been accurately located to date, any information which can clarify positions or confirm new Discoveries is greatly appreciated and new information will be updated to the viewer on an on-going basis.

A Sites and Monuments Record (SMR) was issued for all counties in the State between 1984 and 1992.
The SMR is a manual containing a numbered list of certain and possible monuments accompanied by 6-inch Ordnance Survey maps (at a reduced scale). The SMR formed the basis for issuing the Record of Monuments and Places (RMP) – the statutory list of recorded monuments established under Section 12 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1994. The RMP was issued for each county between 1995 and 1998 in a similar format to the existing SMR. The RMP differs from the earlier lists in that, as defined in the Act, only monuments with known locations or places where there are believed to be monuments are included.   The large Archaeological Survey of Ireland archive and supporting database are managed by the National Monuments Service and the records are continually updated and supplemented as additional monuments are discovered.
On the Historic Environment viewer an area around each monument has been shaded, the scale of which varies with the class of monument.
This area does not define the extent of the monument, nor it define a buffer area beyond which ground threshold should not take place – it merely identifies an area of land within which is expected that the monument will be located. It is not a Constraint area for screening – such must be set by the relevant authority who requires screening for their own purposes.  This data has been released for download as Open Data under the DPER Open Data Strategy and is licensed for re-use under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0 
Please note that the centre point of each record is not indicative of the geographic extent of the monument.
The existing point centroids were digitised relative to the OSI 6-inch mapping and the move from this older IG-referenced series to the larger-scale ITM mapping will require revisions.
The accuracy of the derived ITM co-ordinates is limited to the OS 6-inch scale and errors may ensue should the user apply the co-ordinates to larger scale maps.
Records that do not refer to ‘monuments’ are designated ‘redundant record’ and are retained in the archive as they may relate to that features once considered to be monuments but which on investigation proved otherwise.Redundant may records also Refer to duplicate records or errors in the data structure of the Archaeological Survey of Ireland.

This Dataset also can be viewed and interrogated through the online Historic Environment Viewer: https://heritagedata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=0c9eb9575b544081b0d296436d8f60f8 
A Sites and Monuments Record (SMR) was issued for all counties in the State between 1984 and 1992.
The SMR is a manual containing a numbered list of certain and possible monuments accompanied by 6-inch Ordnance Survey maps (at a reduced scale). The SMR formed the basis for issuing the Record of Monuments and Places (RMP) – the statutory list of recorded monuments established under Section 12 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1994. The RMP was issued for each county between 1995 and 1998 in a similar format to the existing SMR. The RMP differs from the earlier lists in that, as defined in the Act, only monuments with known locations or places where there are believed to be monuments are included.   The large Archaeological Survey of Ireland archive and supporting database are managed by the National Monuments Service and the records are continually updated and supplemented as additional monuments are discovered.
On the Historic Environment viewer an area around each monument has been shaded, the scale of which varies with the class of monument.
This area does not define the extent of the monument, nor it define a buffer area beyond which ground threshold should not take place – it merely identifies an area of land within which is expected that the monument will be located. It is not a Constraint area for screening – such must be set by the relevant authority who requires screening for their own purposes.

Please note that the centre point of each record is not indicative of the geographic extent of the monument.
The existing point centroids were digitised relative to the OSI 6-inch mapping and the move from this older IG-referenced series to the larger-scale ITM mapping will require revisions.
The accuracy of the derived ITM co-ordinates is limited to the OS 6-inch scale and errors may ensue should the user apply the co-ordinates to larger scale maps.
Records that do not refer to ‘monuments’ are designated ‘redundant record’ and are retained in the archive as they may relate to that features once considered to be monuments but which on investigation proved otherwise.Redundant may records also Refer to duplicate records or errors in the data structure of the Archaeological Survey of Ireland.

Ireland is a special place for wild birds. We are at the end of major flyways of waterfowl migrating south for the winter from North America, Greenland, Iceland and the Arctic. In spring and summer, Ireland provides important breeding grounds for species from the continent of Europe or Africa. Our long coastlines provide safe breeding and wintering grounds for large numbers of seabirds. In addition we have resident species which are scarce or rare in other parts of Europe.

Because birds migrate long distances, it is not sufficient to protect them over just part of their range, so the EU Birds Directive provides for a network of sites in all Member States to protect birds at their breeding, feeding, roosting and wintering areas. It identifies species which are rare, in danger of extinction or vulnerable to changes in habitat and which need protection.

In Ireland, we have 25 of these species regularly occurring. They include Bewicks and Whooper Swan, Greenland White-Fronted and Barnacle Geese, Corncrake, Golden Plover, Bar-Tailed Godwit, five species of tern, birds of prey including Hen Harrier, Peregrine, Merlin as well as the Nightjar, Kingfisher and Chough.

Specific proposals to designate Special Protection Areas (SPAs) in order to safeguard certain habitats pursuant to EU Directive requirements were recently advertised in the local press and on local radio. These proposals are intended to safeguard the habitat of these selected sites. 

The EU Birds Directive (79/409/EEC) requires designation of SPAs for:
Listed rare and vulnerable species such as those mentioned above. 
Regularly occurring migratory species, such as ducks, geese and waders. 
Wetlands, especially those of international importance, which attract large numbers of migratory birds each year. (Internationally important means that 1% of the population of a species uses the site, or more than 20,000 birds regularly use the site.)
121 SPAs have been designated since 1985.  25 other sites enjoy legal protection and will shortly by designated as SPAs.  However, further designations are required pursuant to the Birds Directive.  The Minister will be publishing his proposals for the designation of additional sites on an on-going basis in Autumn 2007 and Spring 2008.  It should be noted that many existing and future SPAs overlap with SACs.  The Irish SPAs join a total of around 3,000 sites across the European Union.","http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/data-theme/EDUC, https://data.gov.ie/Arts","coastal heritage, environment, environmental monitoring facilities, heritage council, special protection area","coastal heritage, environment, environmental monitoring facilities, heritage council, special protection area","Dataset owned and provided by NPWS.

— Inventory_of_Irish_Coastal_Lagoons_2011_polygons.shp Dataset which contains information on the lagoons identified in the Inventory of Coastal Lagoons 2007 report.

Foundaries of Brú na Bóinne – Archaeological Ensemble of the Bend of the Boyne World Heritage Property and its buffer zone.

Brú na Bóinne was inscribed on the World Heritage List in 1993. The Listing reflects the site’s status as Europe’s largest and most important concentration of prehistoric megalithic art and as Ireland’s RICHEST Archaeological landscape. The Archaeological landscape within Brú na Bóinne is dominated by three large Neolithic passage tombs, Knowth, Newgrange and Dowth, which contain the largest assemblage of megalithic art in Western Europe. Each year at dawn on the winter solstice (21 December), and for a number of days before and after, a shaft of Sunlight enter the chamber at Newgrange through an opening in the roof box. 

The natural heritage of Brú na Bóinne is also of Importance and it encompasses several Natural Heritage Areas. The Boyne River Islands are one of the country’s few examples of alluvial wet Woodland, which is a priority habitat under the EU Habitat Directive.


Boundaries of Sceilg Mhichíl – World Heritage Property.

Sceilg Mhichíl was inscribed on the World Heritage List in 1996. Sceilg Mhichíl and Sceilg Bheag are towering sea crags rising from the Atlantic Ocean almost 12 kilometres west of the Ivereagh Peninsula in County Kerry. Both islands are internationally renowned as one of the most important sites for Breeding seabirds in Ireland. Found at the western edge of the European landmass, Sceilg Mhichíl was the chosen destination for a small group of ascetic Monks who, in their pursuit of greater union with God, withdrew from civilisation to this remote and inaccessible place. Sometime between the sixth and eight centuries, a monastery was founded on this precipitous rock giving rise to one of the most dramatic examples of the extremes of Christian monasticism. 

The Monastic community moved to the mainland by the thirteenth century and the island remained uninhabited until the Nineteenth century when two Lighthouses were constructed and linked by a remarkable road cut into the rock along the southern edge of the island.","http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/data-theme/ENVI, https://data.gov.ie/Environment","archaeology, environment, ireland, planningcadastre, protected sites","archaeology, environment, ireland, planningcadastre, protected sites","This Dataset Displays locational information for the UNESCO World Heritage sites Brú na Bóinne and Sceilg Mhichíl.

isere, mobilites, routes","graphe, isere, mobilites, routes","Ce jeu de données représente les sections géographiques des routes départementales en Isère, plus quelques RD limitrophes, nationales, autoroutes et métropolitaines.

Le système utilisé pour se localiser sur le réseau routier fonctionne à partir d'un réseau de ""points routiers"" localisé dans l'espace (composé de bornes réelles ou fictives qui jalonnent le réseau routier départemental). 

Ces plots sont ""figés"" dans l'espace mais la constante évolution du réseau routier (création de nouvelle voirie / modification de la voirie existante), fait que la distance Inter-plot ou inter PR (pour point de repère) qui sépare deux plots n'est pas homogène.

En plus des coordonnées géographiques, pour se localiser précisément le long du réseau routier on parlera donc de PR + Absisse : Le PR reprenant le numéro de borne la plus proche (dans le sens montant) et l'absisse correspondant à la distance métrique qui sépare la localisation de la borne du point de localisation final. 

Ce schéma reprend le fonctionnement du ""PR + absisse"" :

stations as part of an effort by Fingal County Council to produce more detailed
rainfall, wind speed, wind direction and temperature records for the county.
The information collected from the weather stations is visible on Met Éireann’s
Weather Observations Website, WOW-IE, providing essential real-time weather
data to the public and to Met Éireann, the OPW and Fingal County Council’s
flood section. The project began in 2021 with Fingal County
Council issuing 100 rainfall gauges to primary schools and further advanced
with 27 automatic weather stations installed across Fingal throughout 2022. Led by Executive Engineer Kevin Vallely, the
project was funded by Fingal County Council’s Chief Executive’s Innovation
Fund. The Fund covered the €5,000 start-up cost for rain gauges and provided
support to get the innovative idea off the ground. See this link for live data : https://wow.met.ie/ We also have one Lusk/Rush which are monitoring air quality at the

It is recommended that this dataset is read in conjunction with the ‘Traffic Data Site Names SDCC’ dataset. A detailed description of each column heading can be referenced below; scn: Site Serial number region: A group of Nodes that are operated under SCOOT control at the same common cycle time. Normally these will be nodes between which co-ordination is desirable. Some of the nodes may be double cycling at half of the region cycle time. system: SCOOT STC UTC (UTC-MX) locn: Locations site: Site numbers day: Days of the week Monday  to Sunday. Abbreviations; MO,TU,WE,TH,FR,SA,SU. date: Reflects correct actual Date of when data was collected. start_time: NOTE - Please ignore the date displayed in this column. The actual data collection date is correctly displayed in the 'date' column. The date displayed here is the date of when report was run and extracted from the system, but correctly reflects start time of 15 minute intervals. end_time: End time of 15 minute intervals. flow: A representation of demand (flow) for each link built up over several minutes by the SCOOT model. SCOOT has two profiles: (1) Short – Raw data representing the actual values over the previous few minutes (2) Long – A smoothed average of values over a longer period SCOOT will choose to use the appropriate profile depending on a number of factors. flow_pc: Same as above ref PC SCOOT cong: Congestion is directly measured from the detector. If the detector is placed beyond the normal end of queue in the street it is rarely covered by stationary traffic, except of course when congestion occurs. If any detector shows standing traffic for the whole of an interval this is recorded. The number of intervals of congestion in any cycle is also recorded. The percentage congestion is calculated from: No of congested intervals x 4 x 100 cycle time in seconds. This percentage of congestion is available to view and more importantly for the optimisers to take into account. cong_pc: Same as above ref PC SCOOT dsat: The ratio of the demand flow to the maximum possible discharge flow, i.e. it is the ratio of the demand to the discharge rate (Saturation Occupancy) multiplied by the duration of the effective green time.

Conservation limits are essentially the minimum number of returning adult salmon a river should have to ensure its stock remains sustainable. For a number of rivers with a sizeable multi-sea-winter (MSW) stock component, catch advice is issued separately for 1SW (grilse) and MSW stocks. Where stocks are below the conservation limit, catch - & - release-only fishing or closure of the fishery may be advised. Th is scientific catch advice is presented to salmon fishery managers for decision-making on fishery status. Fo llowing a public consultation period, the fishery status and total allowable catch for salmon rivers are implemented in legislation each December for the following year . Salmon rivers may also be subject to further bye-laws on opening & closing dates, bag limits, permitted methods, tag requirements, etc. More information on salmon angling regulations can be found at https://fishinginireland.info/salmon/salmonregs/ .

Household waste includes food and residual waste (formerly called vessel and sack waste), bulky waste including garden waste, hazardous waste, comparable waste from, for example, shops, offices, industries and restaurants, and the part of household waste covered by producer responsibility (packaging, newspapers, electrical waste, batteries, etc.), although it does not fall under municipal cleaning responsibility.The number of inhabitants is adjusted to take into account holiday homes, guest nights and commuting. Municipalities with significantly more holiday homes or with extensive tourist activity generate significantly more household waste than what municipalities with mostly permanent residents generate. In municipalities with large commuting surpluses, much household waste is also generated through the workplaces. By using an adjusted number of inhabitants, the amount of waste per person is more accurately reflected for the municipality, which facilitates comparisons with other municipalities.

The issue of Weather Warnings is perhaps the most important function of any National Meteorological Service and lies at the heart of the suite of Public Weather Services provided to citizens by Met Éireann. Warnings are issued on a county-by-county basis. 

Weather Warnings are presented in three categories: 

### Status YELLOW — Weather Alert — Be Aware
The concept behind YELLOW level weather alerts is to Notify those who are at risk because of their location and/or activity, and to allow them to take preventative action. It is implicit that YELLOW level weather alerts are for weather conditions that do not pose an immediate threat to the general population, but only to those Exposed to risk by nature of their location and/or activity. 

### Status ORANGE — Weather Warning — Be Prepared
This category of ORANGE level weather warnings is for weather conditions which have the capacity to impact significantly on people in the affected areas. The issue of an Orange level weather warning implies that all recipients in the affected areas should prepare themselves in an appropriate way for the anticipated conditions. 

### Status RED — Severe Weather Warning — Take Action
The issue of RED level severe weather warnings should be a comparatively rare event and implies that recipients take action to protect themselves and/or their properties; this could be by moving their families out of the danger zone temporarily; by staying Indoors; or by other specific actions aimed at mitigating the effects of the weather conditions.

The DAS dataset (both waveform and cross-spectral density matrices), extracted features, labeled dataset, two trained models (feature extraction model and xgboost classification model), scripts to reproduce the whole training and classification processes, and a notebook to replicate the result analysis part are provided under the MIT license. To provide a reasonable data size, we chunked the raw data to a few hundred channels which we used in our project. 
Abstract: 
Effective use of the wealth of information provided by Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) for mass movement monitoring remains a challenge. We propose a semi-supervised neural network tailored to screen DAS data related to a series of rock collapses leading to a major failure of approximately 1.2 million cubic meters on 15 June 2023 in Brienz, Eastern Switzerland. Besides DAS, the dataset from 16 May to 30 June 2023 includes Doppler radar data for partially ground-truth labeling. The proposed algorithm is capable of distinguishing between rock-slope failures and background noise, including road and train traffic, with a detection precision of over 95%. It identifies hundreds of precursory failures and shows sustained detection hours before and during the major collapse. Event size and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are the key performance dependencies. As a critical part of our algorithm operates unsupervised, we suggest that it is suitable for general monitoring of natural hazards.

The Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic System (scats) is an intelligent Transportation system used to manage timing of signal Phases at traffic signals. Scats uses Sensors at each traffic signal to detect vehicle presence in each lane and pedestrians waiting to cross at the local site. The vehicle Sensors are Generally Inductive Loops installed within the road.

3 resources are provided:

Scats Traffic Volumes Data (Monthly) Contained in this report are traffic Counts taken from the scats traffic detectors located at junctions. The primary function for these traffic detectors is for traffic signal control. Such devices can also count general traffic Volumes at defined locations on approach to a junction. These devices are set at specific locations on approaches to the junction but may not be on all approaches to a junction. As there are multiple junctions on any one route, it could be expected that a vehicle would be counted multiple times as it progress along the route. Setup the traffic volume Counts here are best used to represent trends in vehicle movement by selecting a specific junction on the route which best represents the overall traffic flows.

Information provided:

End Time: time that one hour count period finishes.

Region: location of the detector site (e.g. North City, West City, etc.).

Site: this can be matched with the scats Sites file to show location

Detector: the detectors/Sensors at each site are numbered

Sum volume: total traffic Volumes in preceding hour

Avg volume: average traffic Volumes per 5 minute interval in preceding hour

Vertical profiles of the horizontal mass flux and particle number size distribution of drifting and blowing snow were measured in the lowest 10 m of the atmosphere using four **snow particle counters** (SPCs). Three 3-dimensional **ultrasonic anemometers** were deployed in the lowest 25 m of the atmosphere to record the wind velocity components and sonic temperature at a high frequency of 100 Hz. Additionally, an **automatic weather station** provided air temperature, relative humidity, air pressure, shortwave and longwave downward and upward radiation fluxes, surface temperature, snow temperatures at depths of 0.1 and 0.4 m below the surface, wind speed, and wind direction. The data is complemented by **weather observations** performed twice to eleven times per day by the Japanese Meteorological Agency.
Most of the time, the lowest SPC was situated at a height of 0.05 or 0.1 m above the snow surface. During certain periods called profile runs, the height of the lowest SPC was systematically varied between 0.02 and 0.2 m to increase the vertical resolution of the measured profiles. The other SPC's were installed at fixed heights of 1.1, 3.1, and 9.6 m. During each profile run, the lowest SPC was kept at a specific height for approximately 10 min before changing the height. If the wind speed remained approximately constant throughout a profile run, the data was used to compute the average snow-transport profile in that period. In total, 24 of such average profiles were obtained. A part of these SPC measurements are discussed in Nishimura and Nemoto (2005).
The ultrasonic anemometers were placed at heights of 0.3, 1, and 25 m. However, the height of the lowest ultrasonic anemometer was changed several times in the measurement period and ranged from 0.05 to 0.32 m. On top of that, 19 short periods (each lasting 15 to 160 min) were used to systematically vary the height of the lowest ultrasonic anemometer and thus increase the vertical resolution of the measured wind speed profile. Occasionally, drifting and blowing snow particles perturbed the ultrasonic measurement signal and electrically-charged particles caused an electric charge of the anemometers, leading to artifacts such as spikes and dropouts in the measured time series. These artifacts were largely removed and replaced by NaN, using the statistical spike removal algorithm of Mauder et al. (2013). However, the artifact removal was sometimes incomplete for the lowest anemometer because of very intense snow transport close to the surface. While temporal averages are barely affected by the artifacts, the high-frequency data of the lowest anemometer should be used carefully when computing turbulent fluxes using the eddy-covariance method. Further important explanations are provided in the file Readme.pdf in data resource '(a) Metadata'.

The predecessors of SFIT4 (SFIT & SFIT2) were co-developed over time at NASA Langley, NIWA Lauder NZ and the Univ. of Denver (Chang & Shaw, 1977, Niple, 1980, Goldman et al., 1980, Pougatchev & Rinsland, 1995). This version of SFIT4 v1.0.21 implements a line-by-line code with 1st order line-mixing and the generalized lineshape profile algorithm pCqSDHC (Ngo, 2013) and has the possibility of explicit Total Internal Partition Function (TIPS) calculations (Fischer, 2003). It implements upwards looking geometry using Fourier Transform interferometer spectra. For the retrieval of atmospheric chemical profiles the Optimal Estimation (Rodgers 2000) and Thikonov-Phillips-regularization (Tikhonov 1995) methodologies are implemented. SFIT4 allows the use of a user defined regularization matrix. The raytracing algorithm (FASCATM) is integrated in the code (Smith, et. al., 1978, Gallery, et. al., 1983, Shephard, et. al., 2009).

SFIT4 is one of two standard retrieval codes employed by the NDACC IRWG (NDACC Infrared Working Group) and consequently operationally employed for satellite and model validation, trend evaluation and broad range of atmospheric research purposes.

The SFIT4 retrieval algorithm is designed to work with spectroscopic data from HITRAN (Rothman 2005, Rothman 2013, Gordon 2017, Gordon 2022) and ATM (Toon 2017, Toon 2022).

The algorithm is driven with an a-priori state of the atmosphere (pressure, temperature and volume mixing ratio profiles for the atmospheric constituents). A-priori input profiles for selected sites are extracted from WACCM v6 (Gettelman 2019). The retrieval of temperature profiles is possible from version 1.0.18 onwards.

It contains information on 107 sampling events with 88 validated occurrences of invasive ruddy duck (with 2 additional occurrences reporting on white-headed duck) starting from 2009. These occurrences mainly originate from observations or cullings (through shooting or trapping) of individuals associated with official control actions in Flanders, North Belgium in response to the Bern Convention Action Plan on ruddy duck eradication (Robertson et al. 2015; Bern Convention 2016; Hall 2016). The data are used for feeding the Flemish biodiversity indicator on the progress of ruddy duck eradication. Also, they are used for official reporting to the Bern Convention Action Plan on the eradication of ruddy duck from the Western Palearctic (Bern Convention 2016; Hall 2016) and, as the species is included in the list of invasive species of Union Concern since 2016, for reporting to the EU IAS Regulation (1143/2014) (European Union 2014). The data are also used for research purposes. Here the dataset is published as a standardized Darwin Core Archive and includes for each event: a stable eventID, date and location of observation, and a short description of the sampling protocol (in the event core), supplemented with specific information for each occurrence: a stable occurrenceID, the scientific name and higher classification of the observed species, the number of recorded individuals, sex, life stage, and a reference to the observer and identifier of the record (in the occurrence extension).

Also, they are used for official reporting to the Bern Convention Action Plan on the eradication of ruddy duck from the Western Palearctic (Bern Convention 2016; Hall 2016) and, as the species is included in the list of invasive species of Union Concern since 2016, for reporting to the EU IAS Regulation (1143/2014) (European Union 2014). The data are also used for research purposes. Here the dataset is published as a standardized Darwin Core Archive and includes for each event: a stable eventID, date and location of observation, and a short description of the sampling protocol (in the event core), supplemented with specific information for each occurrence: a stable occurrenceID, the scientific name and higher classification of the observed species, the number of recorded individuals, sex, life stage, and a reference to the observer and identifier of the record (in the occurrence extension).

D_QC relates to dry-snow avalanche conditions only. Measuring the avalanche danger level D is not possible; forecast, nowcast, and hindcast assessments of D are judgments by humans interpreting data. However, combining several pieces of information indicating the same D, it can be expected that it is more likely that D_QC represents the avalanche conditions well. 

For the **forecasting seasons 2001/2002 until 2019/2020**, the approach to obtain D_QC is described in detail in Appendix A of [Pérez-Guillén et. al. (2022)](https://nhess.copernicus.org/articles/22/2031/2022/nhess-22-2031-2022.html).

For the **forecasting seasons 2020/2021 and later**, D_QC is derived using the following approach:
1. *Combination of forecast (D_forecast) and nowcast (D_nowcast)*: If there was only one assessment available by an observer after a day in the field for a region, and if D_forecast = D_nowcast --> D_QC = D_forecast. 
2. *Combination of several nowcast assessments (D_nowcast)*: If two (or more) observers agreed (or majority opinion) in their (independent) assessments of D_nowcast after a day in the field in the same warning region. --> D_QC = D_nowcast. 
3. *Hindcast analysis (D_hindcast)*: In Switzerland, avalanche forecasters re-evaluate all situations when D = 4 (high) or D = 5 (very high) were either forecast, should have been forecast, or when forecasters discussed given one of these two levels but had not given them. Generally, two forecasters assess each situation. In these cases, D_QC = D_hindcast. The hindcast analysis, only available since the forecasting season 2020/2021, replaces what was step (2) in Appendix A of [Pérez-Guillén et. al. (2022)](https://nhess.copernicus.org/articles/22/2031/2022/nhess-22-2031-2022.html). 

All other cases - ties in case of (1) or (2), no new information from the warning region in question, or if no D_hindcast was available - are not considered quality-checked, and are, thus, not contained in the data set.

In addition to D_QC, the file contains information on the elevation and aspect, where D_QC likely prevails.
- The indicated elevation is the mean of the respective elevations in (1), (2), or (3). At danger level 1 (low), when no elevation is indicated in the Swiss forecast, a value of 1500 m is set.
- For the four cardinal aspects N, E, S, and W, a value of 1 means that there was agreement that D was reached in this aspect and a value of 0 means that there was agreement that D was not reached in this aspect. Intermediate values correspondingly mark disagreements in the assessments.",http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/data-theme/EDUC,"avalanche-bulletin, avalanche-danger-level, avalanche-forecast, avalanche-forecasting, verification","avalanche-bulletin, avalanche-danger-level, avalanche-forecast, avalanche-forecasting, verification","The data set contains the re-analyzed (or quality-checked) regional avalanche danger levels (D_QC) for Switzerland.

Households are household-dwelling units. All persons registered in the same apartment are counted to the same household. For more information on household statistics, see Statistics Sweden’s document “Register-based household statistics”. Data from the Register of Total Population (RTB).

In this file there are statistics for a number of variables broken down by Malmö’s different areas over time. 

__Source__

Unless otherwise stated, the statistics in this database are retrieved from Statistics Sweden’s (SCB) regional database, Skånedatabasen or from Statistics Sweden’s area statistics database (OSDB). The Skåne database and OSDB show data from several different sources that Statistics Sweden has compiled on a geographical level. The statistics only cover persons who are part of the population registered in the population. Therefore, persons without a residence permit, such as asylum seekers, and persons who simply have not registered in the municipality are not included. Statistics Sweden does not provide statistics on which language residents speak, which religion you belong to or what ethnicity or political views you have. Therefore, such data is not available here either. However, the Electoral Authority reports election results per constituency on its website val.se. There are statistics from the last election as well as several previous elections available. Please note, however, that the constituencies do not necessarily follow the division of the city made here. 

__Update__

The data is updated every spring as Statistics Sweden releases the figures to the municipality. Most variables are available for the year before. However, income and employment data are released with another year’s backlog. Unless otherwise stated, the date of measurement is 31 December of each year. 

__Geographical breakdown__

Unless otherwise stated, the data is available for Malmö as a whole and broken down into urban areas (5 pieces), districts (10 pieces) and subareas (136 pieces). In addition to these, there is a residual post that contains the people who are not written in a specific place in the municipality, have protected identity and more. These people are also part of the total. In several of the subareas there are no or only a few registered population registers. Therefore, no data are reported for these areas. Examples of such sub-areas are parks such as Pildammsparken and Kroksbäcksparken and industrial areas such as Fosieby Industriområde and Spillepengen. 

__Privacy clearance__

In order to protect the identity of individuals, the data is confidentially audited. This means that small values are suppressed, i.e. replaced by empty cells. However, the values are included in summaries. In general, the following rules apply: 
* No statistics are reported for geographical areas with very few housing. 
* No cells with fewer than 5 individuals are reported. For data classified as sensitive (e.g. income and country of birth), larger values can also be suppressed. 
* In cases where a subcategory (e.g. a training category) is too small to be accounted for, all categories are often suppressed.

The identification of these rivers as Salmon, Sea Trout or other types of systems is still valid and has not changed since the 2003 report was published. It should be noted that rivers identified in 2003 as ‘Not considered a significant producer of migratory Salmonids’ or river segments identified as ‘Not utilised by Salmon’ may hold small populations of salmon and/or sea trout which are important in biodiversity terms. Please note that the wetted areas (riverine habitat (m²)) were revised in 2012 (McGinnity et al., 2012). This work built on the 2003 wetted area report (Mc Ginnity et al., 2003).

The data presented here do not take into account all CCAS-CIAS from the DGFiP source data. Indeed, reprocessing has been carried out and only entities with a non-zero amount of operating expenditure, operating revenue or outstanding debt are retained.

Data for precipitation rates (pr) and potential evapotranspiration (pet) are taken from CHELSA V2.1 (https://doi.org/10.16904/envidat.228.v2.1). Both data sets are monthly time series from 1980 to 2018 at 30 arcsec. and have the unit of kg m-2 month-1. SPEI is a more reliable measure of drought than SPI as it additionally considers the effect of potential evapotranspiration. Potential evapotranspiration (pet) is the amount of water per area per time that can evaporate at the soil surface or be transpired by plants in absence of water supply limitations. SPEI effectively estimates for a given location how the climatic water balance, i.e., the difference between precipitation rate (pr) and potential evapotranspiration (pet), relates to the long-term mean. Here, pet was calculated with the Penman-Montheith approach, assuming surface conductance of a reference crop of 12 cm height following the definition of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), originating from CHELSA-BIOCLIM+ database (https://www.doi.org/10.16904/envidat.332). To obtain global time series of SPEI, in each pixel the frequency distribution of water balance estimates (pr-pet) is approximated with a log-logistic probability distribution function. We calculate monthly SPEI using a 12-month memory and approximate the parameters of the log-logistic probability distribution based on the time series from 1980-2018. Such a 12-month time window is suitable to capture long-term drought events that are long enough to impose substantial impacts on agriculture, hydrology, and ecosystems while ones at shorter time scales would be more appropriate to detect short-term drought. For each month, SPEI is calculated considering the respective water-balance value and the values of the eleven preceding months. Here we use SPEI-12 in December to represent the overall water-balance condition of the respective year. The resulting SPEI data has a horizontal resolution of 130 arcsec (~1km). The calculation of SPI and SPEI is done in R with the package SPEI (https://www.doi.org/10.32614/CRAN.package.SPEI).

The 3D geological model (Pilot area A; ~1300 km2) is located on the West Schleswig Block in the area of the Henni salt pillow (pilot region A). It is based on 2D seismic data from various surveys and geophysical/geological information from four exploration wells. The model comprises 14 generalized faults and the following 14 horizon surfaces: 1) Sea Floor, 2) Mid Miocene Unconformity, 3) Base Rupelian, 4) Base Tertiary, 5) Base Upper Cretaceous, 6) Base Lower Cretaceous, 7) Base Muschelkalk, 8) Base Röt (Pelite), 9) Base Röt (Salinar), 10) Base Solling Formation, 11) Base Detfurth Formation, 12) Base Volpriehausen Formation, 13) Base Triassic, 14) Base Zechstein. The selected potential reservoir structure in the Middle Buntsandstein is formed by an anticline created by the uplift of the underlying Henni salt pillow. The primary reservoir unit is the 40-50 m thick Lower Volpriehausen Sandstone, the main sealing units are the Röt and the Lower Cretaceous. Petrophysical analyses of all considered well data were conducted and reservoir properties (including porosity and permeability) were calculated to determine the static reservoir capacity for these potential CO2 storage structures. Both models were parameterized and can be used for further dynamic simulations of storage capacity, geo-risk, and infrastructure analyses, in order to develop a comprehensive feasibility study for potential CO2 storage within the project framework.

Urban ecosystems are associated with socio-ecological conditions that can filter and promote taxa. However, the strength of the effect of ecological filtering on biodiversity could vary among biotic and abiotic factors.

To do so, we installed trap-nests in 80 sites distributed along urban intensity gradients in 5 European cities (Antwerp, Paris, Poznan, Tartu and Zurich). We quantified the species richness and abundance of CNBW hosts and their natural enemies, as well as two performance traits (survival and parasitism) and two life-history traits (sex ratio and number of offspring per nest for the hosts).

Towards a fair and comprehensive analysis of existing methods, in this paper, we introduce a remote sensing benchmark for multi-modal semantic segmentation based on RGB-Height (RGB-H) data. The introduced RSMSS dataset contains 9340 tiles collected from three different cities, including the Oklahoma, Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia. Each RGB image tile has a corresponding nDSM map provided with the resolution of 1024x1024. We split all the image tiles into three subsets: the training set with 5,137 tiles, the validation set with 1,059 tiles and the test set with 3,144 tiles. All the image pixels are annotated with six different land cover types, including 1. ground; 2. low-vegetation; 3. building; 4. water; 5. road; 6. tree"

Monocular height estimation is one of the most efficient and timely ways to obtain large-scale geometric information.

To this end, we first design and construct a large-scale benchmark dataset for cross-dataset transfer learning on the height estimation task. This benchmark dataset includes a newly proposed large-scale synthetic dataset, a newly collected real-world dataset, and four existing datasets from different cities.

The respective parameter files can be found here: [Github](https://github.com/TLKoch/Sentinel-2_CH). All the image time series consist of several TB and therefore access will be granted upon request. 
The available bands (in spatial reference system EPSG 3035) are the following:
Red, Green, Blue, NIR, Red-Edge-1, Red-Edge-2, Red-Edge-3, SWIR-1, SWIR-2
The available indices (in spatial reference system EPSG 3035) are the following:
CCI, CIRE, NDWI/NDMI, NDVI, EVI
Further indices might be provided upon request.


 Processing
On the basis of processed Sentinel-2 images for the 14 Sentinel-2 tiles covering Switzerland (T31TGN, T32TLT, T32TMT, T32UMU, T32TNT, T32TPT, T31TGM, T32TLS, T32TMS, T32TNS, T32TPS, T32TLR, T32TMR, T32TNR), we processed the image time series further with FORCE v. 3.7.8-12.
We generated interpolated Sentinel-2 time series with a 5-day interval, corresponding to the theoretical revisit time of the Sentinel-2 satellites. It's important to note that the 5-day time series consist of interpolated and smoothed composites, not the original images. We used the radial basis convolutional filtering (RBF) available in the FORCE time series analysis (TSA) submodule (Schwieder et al. 2016). The RBF is similar to a spatial moving window average approach over time (Schwieder et al. 2016). We applied kernel width values of 10, 20, 30, and 50 days. We spectrally adjusted all the images to match Sentinel-2A, and we removed curve outliers and pixels that failed the quality checks for clouds and their shadows, snow, saturation, and limited illumination. The processed image time series are available in tiles of 30 by 30 km.  


 Example images
Uploaded is an example of the index EVI for one of the generated 30 by 30 km tiles located around the city of Zürich. The values are multiplied by 10.000. The time series spans the month of July from 2018.

 Processing
On the basis of processed Sentinel-2 images for the 14 Sentinel-2 tiles covering Switzerland (T31TGN, T32TLT, T32TMT, T32UMU, T32TNT, T32TPT, T31TGM, T32TLS, T32TMS, T32TNS, T32TPS, T32TLR, T32TMR, T32TNR), we processed the image time series further with FORCE v. 3.7.8-12.
We generated interpolated Sentinel-2 time series with a 5-day interval, corresponding to the theoretical revisit time of the Sentinel-2 satellites. It's important to note that the 5-day time series consist of interpolated and smoothed composites, not the original images. We used the radial basis convolutional filtering (RBF) available in the FORCE time series analysis (TSA) submodule (Schwieder et al. 2016). The RBF is similar to a spatial moving window average approach over time (Schwieder et al. 2016). We applied kernel width values of 10, 20, 30, and 50 days. We spectrally adjusted all the images to match Sentinel-2A, and we removed curve outliers and pixels that failed the quality checks for clouds and their shadows, snow, saturation, and limited illumination. The processed image time series are available in tiles of 30 by 30 km.  


 Example images
Uploaded is an example of the index EVI for one of the generated 30 by 30 km tiles located around the city of Zürich. The values are multiplied by 10.000. The time series spans the month of July from 2018."

Abstract
In an increasingly dry environment, it is crucial to understand how tree species use soil water and cope with drought. However, there is still a knowledge gap regarding the relationships between species-specific stomatal behaviour, spatial root distribution, and root water uptake (RWU) dynamics.
Our study aimed to investigate above- and below-ground aspects of water use during soil drying periods in four temperate tree species that differ in stomatal behaviour: two isohydric tracheid-bearing conifers, Scots pine and Norway spruce, and two more anisohydric deciduous species, the diffuse-porous European beech, and the ring-porous Downy oak. From 2015 to 2020, soil-tree-atmosphere-continuum parameters were measured for each species in monospecific forests where trees had no access to groundwater. The hourly time series included data on air temperature, vapour pressure deficit, soil water potential, soil hydraulic conductivity, and RWU to a depth of 2 m. Analysis of drought responses included data on stem radius, leaf water potential, estimated osmotically active compounds, and drought damage.
Our study reveals an inherent coordination between stomatal regulation, fine root distribution and water uptake. Compared to conifers, the more anisohydric water use of oak and beech was associated with less strict stomatal closure, greater investment in deep roots, four times higher maximum RWU, a shift of RWU to deeper soil layers as the topsoil dried, and a more pronounced soil drying below 1 m depth. Soil hydraulic conductivity started to limit RWU when values fell below 10-3 to 10-5 cm/d, depending on the soil. As drought progressed, oak and beech may also have benefited from their leaf osmoregulatory capacity, but at the cost of xylem embolism with around 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity when soil water potential dropped below -1.25 MPa.

Code and resources are in their original form (with documentation). A new version with a more generalized application to PV modelling and with more flexibility in terms of input and output formats will be released in the coming months.

 Format
All code is written and has to be executed in Matlab. The input and output data sets are also in the Matlab-specific .mat format. Whenever publicly available, the original data is provided as geotif, .xlsx or other common format. 
This is the case for:

- Digital Elevation Model (InputsFromMatlab/MSG/OriginalData/ASTERDEM), 
- Landsurface cover type (InputsFromMatlab/MSG/OriginalData/CORINE), 
- Population Density (InputsFromMatlab/MSG/OriginalData/popdensRaster, 
- Electricity production from three of our validation sites (/Validation/WSL), 
- Measured irradiance for two validation sites (/Validation/ASRB)
The ‘Metadata’ documents in the respective folders provide further information about the data sources and processing. Figures are produced either in .pdf or .png format. 

 Structure
The central level of the SUNWELL environment holds the 5 Mains, which run the different modelling aspects of the paper; each code is documented separately. Additional code is located in the ‘DataProcessing’ and the ‘functions’ folder. Functions are called in the different Mains.

‘InputsFromMatlab’ contains the radiation and albedo input data sets in separate subfolders (SIS/SISDIR/ALB). The original data is not publicly available, but can be requested for research purposes free of charge. We provide a processed subset of the data set that was used to run the SUNWELL simulations. The MSG subfolder contains additional spatial input data sets.

‘Outputs’ contains the output files from the different mains (matching names, Main_CHallpixels.m  Prod_CHallpixels)

‘Publication_figures’ contains all individual figures from the PNAS publication, as well as the generating code (/code_plot) and the power point figures (/ppts) that provide the combined final figures.

‘Validation’ contains the data sets used in the model validation:

- Electricity production from three of our validation sites (/WSL),

It holds about 3 million records of vascular plants, dating from 1800 till present.  Furthermore, it includes ecological data on vascular plant species, redlist category information, Ellenberg values, legal status, global distribution, seed bank etc. The database is an initiative of ""Flo.Wer"" (http://www.plantenwerkgroep.be), the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO) (http://www.inbo.be) and the National Botanic Garden of Belgium (http://www.br.fgov.be). Florabank aims at centralizing botanical distribution data gathered by both professional and amateur botanists and to make these data available to the benefit of nature conservation, policy and scientific research. The occurrence data contained in Florabank1 are extracted from checklists, literature and herbarium specimen information. Of survey lists, the locality name (verbatimLocality), species name, observation date and IFBL square code - the grid system used for plant mapping in Belgium (Van Rompaey 1943) - are recorded. For records dating from the period 1972–2004 all pertinent botanical journals dealing with Belgian flora were systematically screened. Analysis of herbarium specimens in the collection of the National Botanic Garden of Belgium, the University of Ghent and the University of Liège provided interesting distribution knowledge concerning rare species, this information is also included in Florabank1.
The IFBL data recorded before 1972 is available through the Belgian GBIF node (http://www.gbif.org/dataset/940821c0-3269-11df-855a-b8a03c50a862), not through Florabank1, to avoid duplication of information. A dedicated portal providing access to all currently published Belgian IFBL records is available at: http://projects.biodiversity.be/ifbl.
All data in Florabank1 is georeferenced. Every record holds the decimal centroid coordinates of the > IFBL square containing the observation. The uncertainty radius is the smallest circle possible covering the whole IFBL square, which can measure 1 km2 or 4 km2. Florabank is a work in progress and new occurrences are added as they become available; the dataset will be updated through GBIF on a regular base.","http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/data-theme/AGRI, http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/data-theme/ENVI","Observation, Occurrence, Tracheophyta, archeophytes, flora, grid mapping, indigenous species, naturalised aliens","Observation, Occurrence, Tracheophyta, archeophytes, flora, grid mapping, indigenous species, naturalised aliens","Florabank1 is a database that contains distributional data on the wild flora (indigenous species, archeophytes and naturalised aliens) of Flanders and the Brussels Capital Region.

The goal is to derive abundance maps from atmospherically corrected Sentinel-2 multispectral images for: photosynthetically active vegetation (PV); and for combined non-Photosynthetically active vegetation (NPV) and bare soil (BS). 

The FCover product for the Netherlands has been generated by processing 10 cloud-free Sentinel-2 tiles which covered the country on 8 September 2016. The map has a spatial resolution of 60 m x 60 m. The Sentinel-2 scene classification layer was used to ensure that the spectral unmixing was only performed on areas of vegetation or soil. 

The abundance maps were made by performing MESMA unmixing on each pixel from an endmember library of PV and combined NPV + BS spectra. The purest pixels in a scene, called endmembers, were extracted using the Spatial-Spectral Endmember Extraction (SSEE) approach. The PV and NPV+BS endmembers were classified with a random forest approach and selected to form the spectral library.

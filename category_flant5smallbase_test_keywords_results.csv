"The material and social deprivation rate is an indicator in EU-SILC that expresses the inability to afford some items considered by most people to be desirable or even necessary to lead an adequate life. The indicator distinguishes between individuals who cannot afford a certain good or service, and those who do not have this good or service for another reason, e.g. because they do not want or do not need it. Severe material and social deprivation rate is defined as the enforced inability to pay for at least 7 out of 13 deprivation items.","Age class, Geopolitical entity (reporting), Sex, Time frequency, Unit of measure",147,deprivation rate

"Foreign direct investment (FDI) is a category of investment that reflects the objective of establishing a lasting interest by a resident enterprise in one economy (direct investor) in an enterprise (direct investment enterprise) that is resident in an economy other than that of the direct investor. The lasting interest implies the existence of a long-term relationship between the direct investor and the direct investment enterprise and a significant degree of influence on the management of the enterprise. The lasting interest is deemed to exist if the investor acquires at least 10% of the voting power of the direct investment enterprise. Data are expressed as % of GDP to remove the effect of differences in the size of the economies of the reporting countries. FDI comprises: - Equity capital comprises equity in branches as well as all shares in subsidiaries and associates. - Reinvested earnings consist of the offsetting entry to the direct investor’s share of earnings not distributed as dividends by subsidiaries or associates, and earnings of branches not remitted to the direct investor and which are recorded under Investment income. - debt instruments Direct investment is classified primarily on a directional basis: 1) Resident direct investment abroad (Outward direct investment) 2) Non-resident investment in the reporting economy (Inward direct investment). The Inward direct investment is investment by a non-resident direct investor in a direct investment enterprise resident in the host economy; the direction of the influence by the direct investor is inward for the reporting economy.

"Background
Urban ecosystems are associated with socio-ecological conditions that can filter and promote taxa. However, the strength of the effect of ecological filtering on biodiversity could vary among biotic and abiotic factors. Here, we provide the data used to investigate the effects of habitat amount, temperature, and host-enemy biotic interactions in shaping communities of cavity-nesting bees and wasps (CNBW) and their natural enemies. To do so, we installed trap-nests in 80 sites distributed along urban intensity gradients in 5 European cities (Antwerp, Paris, Poznan, Tartu and Zurich). We quantified the species richness and abundance of CNBW hosts and their natural enemies, as well as two performance traits (survival and parasitism) and two life-history traits (sex ratio and number of offspring per nest for the hosts).
The dataset contains:
* The taxonomic metrics on CNBW
* The taxonomic metrics on the natural enemies from CNBW

"The project represents the first comprehensive assessment of sand dune systems and their habitats in Ireland.

 Over the course of the three field seasons (2004-2006), all known sites for sand dunes in Ireland were assessed. 
The project involved the updating of an existing inventory of sand dune systems (Curtis, 1991a), the production of habitat maps of all survey sites, the establishment of a coastal habitats database and an assessment of the conservation status of all dune habitats in Ireland, both nationally and on a site-by-site basis.

Furthermore a methodology employing rapid and simple assessment techniques for monitoring sand dune habitats was developed hyperlinked to the records.

This data resource contains:


— a Polygon shapefile with habitat and other information (see lineage) on sites surveyed as part of the Coastal Monitoring Project 2004-2006. Survey areas with Annex 1 habitat types (EU habitats Directive), as well as non-Annex 1 areas (classified using a key developed for the purpose of the project) are contained within the file.


— A MS Access database store information gathered during field surveys for the Coastal Monitoring Project 2004-2006 and the Saltmarsh Monitoring Project 2006-2009.
The data recorded on the field cards for each site were inputted into this database.
The original database was reformatted in 2011 to reflect the newer ‘Monitoring Data Model’ in use within NPWS scientific section, as well as changes to the EU reporting systems.","biodiversity, biota, environment, habitat, habitats and biotopes, heritage, ireland, lutra lutra, national biodiversity plan, npws, species",390,Coastal Monitoring Project 2004-2006 and Saltmarsh Watch

"Data provided by the Marine Institute, and may also incorporate data from other agencies and bodies. Ireland’s ports play a crucial role in facilitating our economic growth and prosperity, as well as food security. Ports and harbours are key sites for land-sea interaction, acting as hubs for a wide range of activities that occur in the maritime area. The National Ports Policy (NPP) provides the framework for the provision of port services. Strategic development of ports is also supported through the Government’s National Development Plan and National Planning Framework.  In a European context, Regulation (EU) No 1315/2013 sets out a common framework for the creation of state-of-the-art, interoperable networks for the development of the internal market: the trans-European transport networks (TEN-T). The NMPF aims to safeguard the operation of ports as key actors in the economic wellbeing of the State through the provision of safe and sustainable maritime transport, and to facilitate a competitive and effective market for maritime transport services. NMPF policies also help to ensure adequate capacity to meet present and future demand and emphasises the need to adapt to the impacts of climate change.","Marine Spatial Planning, dgihousing, harbours, open data, ports, shipping",665,"port harbour, national ports policy"

The ECB defines price stability on the basis of the annual rate of change of the euro area HICP. HICPs are compiled on the basis of harmonised standards, binding for all Member States. Conceptually, the HICP are Laspeyres-type price indices and are computed as annual chain-indices allowing for weights changing each year. HICP are broken down by category of consumption expenditure on the basis of the ECOICOP-HICP classification. HICP are produced and published using a common index reference period (2015 = 100).

"The Balance of Payments is the statistical statement that systematically summarises transactions between residents and non-residents. It consists of the goods and services account, the primary income account, the secondary income account, the capital account and the financial account (BPM6 – 2.12) The capital account in the international accounts shows a) capital transfers receivable and payable between residents and nonresidents and b) the acquisition and disposal of nonproduced, nonfinancial assets between residents and nonresidents (BPM6- 13.1). The capital transfers are transfers in which the ownership of an asset (other than cash or inventories) changes from one party to another. The sum of the balances on the current and capital accounts represents the net lending (surplus) or net borrowing (deficit) by the economy with the rest of the world (BPM6 – 2.18).

"The Retail Trade Index is a business cycle indicator which shows the monthly activity of the retail sector in value and volume. It is a short-term indicator for final domestic demand. It should be noted that the volume of sales is different from the volume of (retail) trade services. The latter takes account of changes in the quality of the trade service supplied. As such the volume of sales is conceptually different from the index of production which takes account of quality changes. Data are compiled according to the Statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community, (NACE Rev. 2, Eurostat). Turnover for retail trade are compiled as a ""fixed base year Laspeyres type volume-index"". The current base year is 2021 (Index 2021 = 100).

Conceptually, the HICP are Laspeyres-type price indices and are computed as annual chain-indices allowing for weights changing each year. HICP are broken down by category of consumption expenditure on the basis of the ECOICOP-HICP classification. HICP are produced and published using a common index reference period (2015 = 100).

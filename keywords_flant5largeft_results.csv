"Harmonised Indices of Consumer Prices (HICP) are designed for international comparisons of consumer price inflation. HICPs are used for the assessment of the inflation convergence criterion as required under Article 121 of the Treaty of Amsterdam and by the ECB for assessing price stability for monetary policy purposes. The ECB defines price stability on the basis of the annual rate of change of the euro area HICP. HICPs are compiled on the basis of harmonised standards, binding for all Member States. Conceptually, the HICP are Laspeyres-type price indices and are computed as annual chain-indices allowing for weights changing each year. HICP are broken down by category of consumption expenditure on the basis of the ECOICOP-HICP classification. HICP are produced and published using a common index reference period (2015 = 100). Growth rates are calculated from published index levels. Indexes, as well as both growth rates with respect to the previous month (M/M-1) and with respect to the corresponding month of the previous year (M/M-12) are neither calendar nor seasonally adjusted.","Geopolitical entity (reporting), Time frequency, Unit of measure",727,"Geopolitical entity (reporting), Time frequency, Unit of measure"

"The dataset provides 2694 stereomicroscopic 8-bit RGB JPEG images of 44 sampling times from two 48 h submerged cultivations of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger. The cultivations were performed in shake flasks with identical cultivation parameters. About 1300 images were taken for each cultivation flask. At least 24 images per culture and sampling time were taken. The stereomicroscopic images depict the development of Aspergillus niger pellets starting from the agglomeration of spores after inoculation followed by spore germination and outgrowth into a pellet population. The following pixel sizes and field of views (FoV) were used at the different sampling times: 0 h – 1.5 h, pixel size 0.82 µm, FoV 1.49 mm × 1.12 mm; 2 h – 2.5 h, pixel size 1.63 µm, FoV 2.97 mm × 2.22 mm; 3 h – 3.5 h, pixel size 3.33 µm, FoV 6.07 mm × 4.55 mm; 4 h – 48 h, pixel size 4.08 µm, FoV 7.44 mm × 5.58 mm.","aspergillus-niger, differential-interference-contrast, image-analysis, microscopy, morphology-development, pellet-growth, spore-agglomeration-aggregation, stereomicroscopy",2903,"aspergillosis, submerged-cultivation, spore-germination, fungus"

"Gross domestic product (GDP) is a measure of the economic activity, defined as the value of all goods and services produced less the value of any goods or services used in their creation. The calculation of the annual growth rate of GDP volume is intended to allow comparisons of the dynamics of economic development both over time and between economies of different sizes. For measuring the growth rate of GDP in terms of volumes, the GDP at current prices are valued in the prices of the previous year and the thus computed volume changes are imposed on the level of a reference year; this is called a chain-linked series. Accordingly, price movements will not inflate the growth rate.","Geopolitical entity (reporting), Time frequency, Unit of measure",271,"Geopolitical entity (reporting), Time frequency, Unit of measure"

"Foreign direct investment (FDI) is a category of investment that reflects the objective of establishing a lasting interest by a resident enterprise in one economy (direct investor) in an enterprise (direct investment enterprise) that is resident in an economy other than that of the direct investor. The lasting interest implies the existence of a long-term relationship between the direct investor and the direct investment enterprise and a significant degree of influence on the management of the enterprise. The lasting interest is deemed to exist if the investor acquires at least 10% of the voting power of the direct investment enterprise. Data are expressed as % of GDP to remove the effect of differences in the size of the economies of the reporting countries. FDI comprises: - Equity capital comprises equity in branches as well as all shares in subsidiaries and associates. - Reinvested earnings consist of the offsetting entry to the direct investor’s share of earnings not distributed as dividends by subsidiaries or associates, and earnings of branches not remitted to the direct investor and which are recorded under Investment income. - Debt instruments Direct investment is classified primarily on a directional basis: 1) Resident direct investment abroad (Outward direct investment) 2) Non-resident investment in the reporting economy (Inward direct investment). The Inward direct investment is investment by a non-resident direct investor in a direct investment enterprise resident in the host economy; the direction of the influence by the direct investor is inward for the reporting economy. Starting from October 2014 definitions are based on the IMF's Sixth Balance of Payments Manual (BPM6).","BOP_item, Geopolitical entity (partner), Geopolitical entity (reporting), Seasonal adjustment, Stock or flow, Time frequency, Unit of measure",3035,"BOP_item, Geopolitical entity (partner), Geopolital entity (reporting), Seasonal adjustment, Stock or flow, Time frequency, Unit of measure"

"This GIS Dataset holds records from the Badger and Habitat Survey of Ireland 1989-1995. The survey was carried out on behalf of the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Department of Agriculture. In total, 7 291 km squares were assessed for badger setts and by habitat composition, with surveys undertaken mainly
by Conservation Rangers of the National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service. In order to obtain results on an all-Ireland basis the survey was extended to Northern Ireland. The survey in the North was carried out between 1990 and 1993 by researchers from the Department of Biology and Biochemistry Queen’s University of Belfast with close co-operation between researchers in the North and in the Republic.

This project’s principal found has been to assess the overall numbers of Badgers in Ireland and to provide a base-line for assessment of any future changes in badger numbers, to identify regional variations in density, to evaluate the extent of illegal digging or disturbance of setts and to relate badger density to the distribution and type of habitats present in an area.

"Foreign direct investment (FDI) is a category of investment that reflects the objective of establishing a lasting interest by a resident enterprise in one economy (direct investor) in an enterprise (direct investment enterprise) that is resident in an economy other than that of the direct investor. The lasting interest implies the existence of a long-term relationship between the direct investor and the direct investment enterprise and a significant degree of influence on the management of the enterprise. The lasting interest is deemed to exist if the investor acquires at least 10% of the voting power of the direct investment enterprise. Data are expressed as % of GDP to remove the effect of differences in the size of the economies of the reporting countries. FDI comprises: - Equity capital comprises equity in branches as well as all shares in subsidiaries and associates. - Reinvested earnings consist of the offsetting entry to the direct investor’s share of earnings not distributed as dividends by subsidiaries or associates, and earnings of branches not remitted to the direct investor and which are recorded under Investment income. - debt instruments Direct investment is classified primarily on a directional basis: 1) Resident direct investment abroad (Outward direct investment) 2) Non-resident investment in the reporting economy (Inward direct investment). The Inward direct investment is investment by a non-resident direct investor in a direct investment enterprise resident in the host economy; the direction of the influence by the direct investor is inward for the reporting economy. Starting from October 2014 definitions are based on the IMF's Sixth Balance of Payments Manual (BPM6).","BOP_item, Geopolitical entity (partner), Geopolitical entity (reporting), Seasonal adjustment, Stock or flow, Time frequency, Unit of measure",3041,"BOP_item, Geopolitical entity (partner), Geopolitic entity (reporting), Seasonal adjustment, Stock or flow, Time frequency, Unit of measure"

"As an Island nation, fishing has always been economically and socially important to our country. Ireland’s proximity to the rich, productive seas of the North East Atlantic provides an ideal resource on which to continue to develop the seafood sector. Ireland’s coastline, inshore and offshore waters contain some of the largest and most valuable sea fisheries resources in Europe. The NMPF supports management of sea-fisheries resources consistent with relevant environmental sustainability considerations and the development of the sector’s economic and social contribution to rural and coastal communities. The NMPF’s objectives in this sector include continuing to develop a sustainable seafood sector focused on competitiveness and innovation, with growth driven by a skilled workforce delivering value added products in line with market demands; promotion of a sustainable, profitable and self-reliant industry; sustaining primary food producers contributing to food security at a national and European level.  The evaluation of potential impacts on any commercial sea fishing activities needs to be given full consideration. Engagement with the fishing industry and other relevant stakeholders should occur as early as possible in planning or proposal-related processes to afford a chance for proper consideration of the industry’s views.","Marine Spatial Planning, dgihousing, fisheries, open data",648,"Marine Spatial Planning, dgihousing, fisheries, open data"

Distance sampling was used to derive g(0), which is the density of harbour porpoises on the track of the vessel. Passionate acoustic monitoring was carried out through the deployment of self-contained click detectors called T-pods, which identify and log the echolocation clicks of harbour porpoises.

A total of 74 tracks were surveyed of a total distance of 460 km. A total of 44 sightings of 102 individual harbour porpoise were recorded.

"Gross domestic product (GDP) is a measure for the economic activity. It refers to the value of the total output of goods and services produced by an economy, less intermediate consumption, plus net taxes on products and imports. GDP per capita is calculated as the ratio of GDP to the average population in a specific year. Basic figures are expressed in purchasing power standards (PPS), which represents a common currency that eliminates the differences in price levels between countries to allow meaningful volume comparisons of GDP. The values are also offered as an index calculated in relation to the European Union average set to equal 100. If the index of a country is higher than 100, this country's level of GDP per head is higher than the EU average and vice versa. Please note that this index is intended for cross-country comparisons rather than for temporal comparisons. Finally, the disparities indicator offered for EU aggregates is calculated as the coefficient of variation of the national figures. This time series offers a measure of the convergence of economic activity between the EU Member States.","Geopolitical entity (reporting), Time frequency, Unit of measure",1867,"Geopolitical entity (reporting), Time frequency, Unit of measure"

"Since the mid-1950s, the number of amphibians being killed on roads has increased dramatically. Every year, hundreds of thousands of amphibians cross roads in Switzerland during their migration between land habitats and spawning grounds and are often killed on the roads if there are no protective measures in place. Not only is this a safety problem for traffic, but it is also causing massive declines in amphibian populations. Migration within populations always occurs along more or less the same migration routes. Migration is seasonal and allows temporary use of different, spatially distinct habitat types. These migration movements are essential to the survival of the populations. Info fauna karch keeps a database of conflict sites between amphibian migration and transport infrastructure. There are currently just under 2,000 known conflict sites, known as “amphibian migration sites”. Depending on the size of the amphibian population, traffic density and the possibilities on site, the protection measures included here are implemented, such as installing small animal tunnels and guiding devices, temporary amphibian fences, temporary road closures or temporary patrols. The known conflict sites of amphibian migration in Switzerland are included in this geodata set and can be visualised.","amphibian, crossing-place-for-animals, environment, fsdi-federal-spatial-data-infrastructure, habitats-and-biotopes, transport, transport-networks",1501,"fauna, transport, population-trends, protected sites, venomous animals, transportation"

"Data provided by the Marine Institute, and may also incorporate data from other agencies and bodies. Ireland’s ports play a crucial role in facilitating our economic growth and prosperity, as well as food security. Ports and harbours are key sites for land-sea interaction, acting as hubs for a wide range of activities that occur in the maritime area. The National Ports Policy (NPP) provides the framework for the provision of port services. Strategic development of ports is also supported through the Government’s National Development Plan and National Planning Framework.  In a European context, Regulation (EU) No 1315/2013 sets out a common framework for the creation of state-of-the-art, interoperable networks for the development of the internal market: the trans-European transport networks (TEN-T). The NMPF aims to safeguard the operation of ports as key actors in the economic wellbeing of the State through the provision of safe and sustainable maritime transport, and to facilitate a competitive and effective market for maritime transport services. NMPF policies also help to ensure adequate capacity to meet present and future demand and emphasises the need to adapt to the impacts of climate change.","Marine Spatial Planning, dgihousing, harbours, open data, ports, shipping",667,"Marine Spatial Planning, dgihousing, harbours, open data, ports, shipping"
"The unemployment rate is the number of unemployed persons as a percentage of the labour force (the total number of people employed and unemployed) based on International Labour Office (ILO) definition. Unemployed persons comprise persons aged 15 to 74 who fulfil all three following conditions: - are without work during the reference week; - are available to start work within the next two weeks; - have been actively seeking work in the past four weeks or have already found a job to start within the next three months. The indicator monitors high and persistent rates of unemployment and it helps to better understand the potential severity of macroeconomic imbalances. It points towards a potential misallocation of resources and general lack of adjustment capacity in the economy. The MIP scoreboard indicator is the three-year backward moving average, i.e. the data for year Y is the arithmetic average of data for years Y, Y-1 and Y-2. It is calculated: [URt+URt-1+URt-2]/3. The indicative threshold is 10%. The data source is the quarterly EU Labour Force Survey (EU LFS). The EU LFS covers the resident population in private households.","Age class, Geopolitical entity (reporting), Sex, Time frequency, Unit of measure",1143,"Age class, Geopolitical entity (reporting), Sex, Time frequency, Unit of measure"
"This dataset presents findings from environmental impact assessments conducted from 2005 to 2023 in different OWFs of the BPNS. Samples were collected by means of Van Veen grab of 0.1m². Some samples belonging to the monitoring of one turbine (D5) in C-Power were collected by divers a differents distances (1, 7, 15, 25, 50, 100, 200 m) from the scour protection layer in 2010, 2011 and 2012. Subsamples of each Van Veen were taken for grain size analysis, and total organic matter content analysis. The remaining part of the Van Veen were sieved over a 1 mm sieve on board and stored in a 4% formaldehyde-seawater solution. In the laboratory, the samples were stained with 1% Rose Bengal, and rinsed over a 1 mm sieve. The organisms were counted and identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level (generally: species level). The organisms were also weighted using the ash-free dry weight (2005 to 2013) and the blotted wet weight (2014 onwards). The samples were then stored in a 4% buffered formaldehyde solution"".","Macrobenthos communities, offshore wind farm, sea bed, seabed sediments",803,"marine sediments, scour protection layer, hydrocarbons, hydroelectricity, open data, seabed sediments"
"The Turnover Index is a business cycle indicator showing the monthly evolution of the market of goods and services in the industrial sector. It also records the evolution of turnover over longer periods of time. The turnover of industry index is not deflated. It is therefore the objective of this indicator to measure the market activity in the industrial sector in value. Data are compiled according to the Statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community, (NACE Rev. 2, Eurostat). Industrial turnover is compiled as a ""fixed base year Laspeyres type volume-index"". The current base year is 2021 (Index 2021 = 100). The index is presented in calendar and seasonally adjusted form. Growth rates with respect to the previous month (M/M-1) are calculated from calendar and seasonally adjusted figures while growth rates with respect to the same month of the previous year (M/M-12) are calculated from calendar adjusted figures.","Business trend indicator, Geopolitical entity (reporting), Time frequency, Unit of measure",2,"Business trend indicator, Geopolitical entity (reporting), Time frequency, Unit of measure"

"This indicator corresponds to the sum of persons who are: at risk of poverty or severely materially or socially deprived or living in households with very low work intensity. Persons are only counted once even if they are present in several sub-indicators. At risk-of-poverty are persons with an equivalised disposable income below the risk-of-poverty threshold, which is set at 60 % of the national median equivalised disposable income (after social transfers). Severely materially or socially deprived persons have living conditions severely constrained by a lack of resources, they experience at least 7 out of 13 following deprivations items: cannot afford i) to pay rent or utility bills, ii) keep home adequately warm, iii) face unexpected expenses, iv) eat meat, fish or a protein equivalent every second day, v) a week holiday away from home, vi) have access to a car/van for personal use; vii) replace worn out furniture; viii) replace worn-out clothes with some new ones; ix) have two pairs of properly fitting shoes; x) spend a small amount of money each week on him/herself (“pocket money”); xi) have regular leisure activities; xii) get together with friends/family for a drink/meal at least once a month; and xiii) have an internet connection. People living in households with very low work intensity are those aged 0-64 living in households where the adults (aged 18-64) work 20% or less of their total work potential during the past year. The indicator is based on the EU-SILC (statistics on income, social inclusion and living conditions).","Age class, Geopolitical entity (reporting), Sex, Time frequency, Unit of measure",98,"Age class, Geopolitical entity (reporting), Sex, Time frequency, Unit of measure"

"The product shows tree canopy cover loss in Germany between January 2018 and April 2021 at monthly temporal and 10 m spatial resolution. The basic principle behind this map is to compute monthly composites of the disturbance index (DI, Healey et al. 2005), a spectral index sensitive to forest disturbance, from all available Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 data with less than 80 % cloud cover. These monthly composites are then compared to a median composite of the DI for 2017, which serves as a reference. After applying a threshold to the difference image, the time series of detected losses is checked for consistency. Only losses recorded continuously in all observations of a pixel until the end of the time series are considered. The dataset does not differentiate between the drivers of the losses. It depicts areas of natural disturbances (windthrow, fire, droughts, insect infestation) as well as sanitation and salvage logging, and regular forest harvest. The full description of the method and results can be found in Thonfeld et al. (2022).","canopy-cover-loss, disturbance-index, drought, forest, germany, land-cover, landsat-8, opendata, sentinel-2",3122,"forest, disturbance-index, sentinel-2, time-series-analysis, woodland"

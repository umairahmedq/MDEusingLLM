"Data provided by the Marine Institute, and may also incorporate data from other agencies and bodies. Ireland’s ports play a crucial role in facilitating our economic growth and prosperity, as well as food security. Ports and harbours are key sites for land-sea interaction, acting as hubs for a wide range of activities that occur in the maritime area. The National Ports Policy (NPP) provides the framework for the provision of port services. Strategic development of ports is also supported through the Government’s National Development Plan and National Planning Framework.  In a European context, Regulation (EU) No 1315/2013 sets out a common framework for the creation of state-of-the-art, interoperable networks for the development of the internal market: the trans-European transport networks (TEN-T). The NMPF aims to safeguard the operation of ports as key actors in the economic wellbeing of the State through the provision of safe and sustainable maritime transport, and to facilitate a competitive and effective market for maritime transport services. NMPF policies also help to ensure adequate capacity to meet present and future demand and emphasises the need to adapt to the impacts of climate change.","Marine Spatial Planning, dgihousing, harbours, open data, ports, shipping",650,"port, ten-t"

"The punctuality metric represents the proportion of trains that, over the course of a month, arrived with a maximum delay of 5 minutes and 59 seconds at their destination or - for trains travelling through Brussel's North-South junction, upon arrival at the first station of the junction on their path.
What is neutralization ?
According to the terms of the management contract, certain categories of delays can be neutralized (meaning that they don't have to be accounted for in the punctuality metrics). For example, delays generated by sources external to Infrabel's or SNCB's activities (railroad crossing accidents, cable thefts, delays from foreign railroad networks, vandalism, assaults...), or delays that are the consequence of planned and communicated infrastructure works, can be neutralized.
The ""neutralized"" punctuality metric is not intended to represent the passenger's observations, but rather to enable Infrabel and the railway operators to draw up their own balance sheet.
In order to have a good general idea of the national punctuality, the punctuality metric ""without neutralization"" should be preferred.","Domestic trains, National, Passengers, Punctuality",1899,"train, punctuality"

"Harmonised Indices of Consumer Prices (HICP) are designed for international comparisons of consumer price inflation. HICPs are used for the assessment of the inflation convergence criterion as required under Article 121 of the Treaty of Amsterdam and by the ECB for assessing price stability for monetary policy purposes. The ECB defines price stability on the basis of the annual rate of change of the euro area HICP. HICPs are compiled on the basis of harmonised standards, binding for all Member States. Conceptually, the HICP are Laspeyres-type price indices and are computed as annual chain-indices allowing for weights changing each year. HICP are broken down by category of consumption expenditure on the basis of the ECOICOP-HICP classification. HICP are produced and published using a common index reference period (2015 = 100). Growth rates are calculated from published index levels.

"A GIS based quantification of Ireland's freshwater salmon habitat asset to determine the habitat quantity (wetted river and lake surface areas) available to migratory salmonids.  The purpose was to inform the further development of salmon stock recruitment models to provide high quality scientific advice to inform the sustainable management of salmon fisheries in Ireland. The identification of these rivers as Salmon, Sea Trout or other types of systems is still valid and has not changed since the 2003 report was published. It should be noted that rivers identified in 2003 as ‘Not considered a significant producer of migratory Salmonids’ or river segments identified as ‘Not utilised by Salmon’ may hold small populations of salmon and/or sea trout which are important in biodiversity terms. Please note that the wetted areas (riverine habitat (m²)) were revised in 2012 (McGinnity et al., 2012). This work built on the 2003 wetted area report (Mc Ginnity et al., 2003).

"The Sentinel-2 fractional vegetation cover (FCover) product for the Netherlands was produced as part of the NextGEOSS project at the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The goal is to derive abundance maps from atmospherically corrected Sentinel-2 multispectral images for: photosynthetically active vegetation (PV); and for combined non-Photosynthetically active vegetation (NPV) and bare soil (BS). 

The FCover product for the Netherlands has been generated by processing 10 cloud-free Sentinel-2 tiles which covered the country on 8 September 2016. The map has a spatial resolution of 60 m x 60 m. The Sentinel-2 scene classification layer was used to ensure that the spectral unmixing was only performed on areas of vegetation or soil. 

The abundance maps were made by performing MESMA unmixing on each pixel from an endmember library of PV and combined NPV + BS spectra. The purest pixels in a scene, called endmembers, were extracted using the Spatial-Spectral Endmember Extraction (SSEE) approach. The PV and NPV+BS endmembers were classified with a random forest approach and selected to form the spectral library. The spectral library was used in the µMESMA unmixing to get the PV and NPV+BS abundances.","land-cover, multispectral-imaging, netherlands, opendata, sentinel-2, soil-cover, vegetation-cover",3127,"a, b, c, dl, Netherlands, Sentinel-2"

Ecosystems provide a series of services for human well-being (ecosystem services) either directly (as food and fibre) or indirectly by providing clean air and water. Biodiversity plays a key role in the functioning of ecosystems and their ability to provide ecosystem services. The value of biodiversity and benefits from ecosystem services reach far beyond that which can be measured in financial terms. Evidence from monitoring of natural habitats and species in Ireland’s marine environment indicates that many habitats are not in good condition.

Ireland’s proximity to the rich, productive seas of the North East Atlantic provides an ideal resource on which to continue to develop the seafood sector. Ireland’s coastline, inshore and offshore waters contain some of the largest and most valuable sea fisheries resources in Europe. The NMPF supports management of sea-fisheries resources consistent with relevant environmental sustainability considerations and the development of the sector’s economic and social contribution to rural and coastal communities. The NMPF’s objectives in this sector include continuing to develop a sustainable seafood sector focused on competitiveness and innovation, with growth driven by a skilled workforce delivering value added products in line with market demands; promotion of a sustainable, profitable and self-reliant industry; sustaining primary food producers contributing to food security at a national and European level.  The evaluation of potential impacts on any commercial sea fishing activities needs to be given full consideration.

"A GIS based quantification of Ireland's freshwater salmon habitat asset to determine the habitat quantity (wetted river and lake surface areas) available to migratory salmonids.  The purpose was to inform the further development of salmon stock recruitment models to provide high quality scientific advice to inform the sustainable management of salmon fisheries in Ireland. The identification of these rivers as Salmon, Sea Trout or other types of systems is still valid and has not changed since the 2003 report was published. It should be noted that rivers identified in 2003 as ‘Not considered a significant producer of migratory Salmonids’ or river segments identified as ‘Not utilised by Salmon’ may hold small populations of salmon and/or sea trout which are important in biodiversity terms. Please note that the wetted areas (riverine habitat (m²)) were revised in 2012 (McGinnity et al., 2012). This work built on the 2003 wetted area report (Mc Ginnity et al., 2003).

"Gross domestic product (GDP) is a measure for the economic activity. It is defined as the value of all goods and services produced less the value of any goods or services used in their creation. GDP per person employed is intended to give an overall impression of the productivity of national economies expressed in relation to the European Union average. If the index of a country is higher than 100, this country's level of GDP per person employed is higher than the EU average and vice versa. Basic figures are expressed in PPS, i.e. a common currency that eliminates the differences in price levels between countries allowing meaningful volume comparisons of GDP between countries. Please note that 'persons employed' does not distinguish between full-time and part-time employment. Labour productivity per hour worked is calculated as real output per unit of labour input (measured by the total number of hours worked). Measuring labour productivity per hour worked provides a better picture of productivity developments in the economy than labour productivity per person employed, as it eliminates differences in the full time/part time composition of the workforce across countries and years.","Geopolitical entity (reporting), Time frequency, Unit of measure",694,"GDP, total"
